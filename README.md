# Data Representation and Querying Project Eliza-ChatBot
My name is Kevin Barry I am a third year software developement student in G.M.I.T. 
This repository was created as part of a project for the module [Data Representation and Querying](https://data-representation.github.io/)

The objective of this project was to create a chatbot web application in Go. The project description can be found [here](https://data-representation.github.io/problems/project.html) 

#### What is an ELiza Chatbot
ELIZA is an early natural language processing computer program created from 1964 to 1966 at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory by Joseph Weizenbaum. In this project the aim was to create a chatbot that resembled a human speaking bot and give the illusion that the machine was learning and engaging in conversation.
To find out more about the Eliza program here is a link to which I refered to in order to gauge a more indept understanding of what Eliza is all about [Wikipedia ELIZA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA)
